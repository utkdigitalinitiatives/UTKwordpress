  <h2>Welcome to &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo;</h2>
         <h3>(&ldquo;The Hill&rdquo; is our code-name for this UT WordPress Theme).</h3>

  <p>Many years ago, UT was founded as Blount College in downtown Knoxville. It was a fine little college, but downtown was not a good location for it. Eventually, Blount College moved to &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo; where it rightfully belonged. The 2015 web templates and WordPress theme are called &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo; to remind us of how we can always rethink seemingly insurmountable obstacles and boldly make big changes without fear or trepidation.</p>
  <p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s what it takes to get where you belong.</p>

        <p>WordPress is one of the content management solutions chosen by the Office of Communications and Marketing for departments and units at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. WordPress began as blogging software, but has evolved into a full fledged content management system. Please feel free to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">learn more about WordPress</a> to use your new website to its full capabilities.</p>
        <p>Our WordPress theme is based upon the <a href="http://communications.utk.edu/resources/web/">UT web templates for university websites</a>. The web templates and this WordPress theme share a strong and easily identifiable visual consistency. While individual units and departments should&#8212;and will&#8212;have their own identities and content, we are all a part of something much larger. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with <a href="http://communications.utk.edu/resources/web/">the required elements</a> of this WordPress theme.</p>
